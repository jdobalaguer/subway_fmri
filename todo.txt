** DONE
GLM:  don't use a mask
GLM:  set regressors from the scan3_glm.m  file

** TODO
MVPA: set regressors from the scan3_mvpa.m file
MVPA: doesn't work with do_pooling = 0
MVPA: set runs properly
MVPA: complete the scan3_mvpa_summarize.m file
MVPA: save results
MVPA: save-to-disk option (not to run out of RAM)
MVPA: when shifting regressors, it's taking a different name (so you don't use the shifted ones!)

MVPA: using switch/repeat is not balanced. chance level is not 50% but around 75%
      use something better (actions

MVPA: find a way to shut up the princeton-toolbox. and spm, ideally. write a fprintf line in the scan3_mvpa_*.m files
MVPA: we're ignoring the "name_image" global variable

PREC: re-run preprocessing without subsampling to improve mvpa.

SCI:  try with >0 duration?
