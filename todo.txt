** DONE
GLM:  don't use a mask
GLM:  set regressors from the scan3_glm.m  file
DATA: any backwards
DATA: face regressors
DATA: subgoal regressors
SCI:  check if distance to subgoal (U) is back
SCI:  try 3-way interaction, X*S*Zsubway_
DATA: distance to elbow
DATA: distance to subgoal (for real)
DATA: remake distance to boundary, and boundary
DATA: block.feedback distance_in_stations to end by the time it was cancelled
DATA: block.feedback distance_in_sublines to end by the time it was cancelled
DATA: block.feedback (easy / hard)
ANYS: add durations
ANYS: main effect of reward?
SCAN: group all global variables into a single struct

** ANALYSIS
ANYS: interactions?
ANYS: distance to elbow/subgoal/goal (in stations), and distance (in lines) to goal
ANYS: decoding : which line are you on?
ANYS: decoding : are you on a face or a scene?
ANYS: decoding : where are you in the map?
ANYS: decoding : which subgoal are you aiming for?

** TODO
DATA: duration regressors
GLM:  improve set_contrasts

MVPA: set regressors from the scan3_mvpa.m file
MVPA: doesn't work with do_pooling = 0 (assert or fix?)
MVPA: set runs properly
MVPA: create a mask automatically
MVPA: complete the scan3_mvpa_summarize.m file
MVPA: save results
MVPA: save-to-disk option (not to run out of RAM)
MVPA: when shifting regressors, it's taking a different name (so you don't use the shifted ones!)
MVPA: use d-prime to improve evaluation
MVPA: we're only using betas from the GLM


** LONG-TERM TODOs
PREC: re-run preprocessing without subsampling to improve mvpa.
MVPA: find a way to shut up the princeton-toolbox. and spm, ideally. write a fprintf line in the scan3_mvpa_*.m files
