** DONE
SCAN: group all global variables into a single struct
ANYS: distance (in lines) to goal
PERI: fix peri_2
PERI: fix peri_1
PERI: fix peri_b
DOCS: report stuff found so far
ANYS: plot bars for R,I,C,L
ANYS: left amygdala > right amygdala. same direction
GLM:  call "statistics" to the "contrasts" folder, create a new folder called "contrasts"
PLOT: create plot_bar_c
PLOT: create plot_peri_c
PLOT: fix plot_bar_2
REGS: optm can change line
REGS: optm must change line
BHAV: do they change more than they need? as much as possible? where in this range? 50% when they can but don't need to.
PLOT: learn how to export 3d brains into blender
MVPA: fix glm
MVPA: force mvpa to use pooling

** ANALYSIS
ANYS: C * length(sub-journey)
ANYS: sequential C activation
ANYS: glm with interactions?
ANYS: distance to elbow/subgoal/goal (in stations)
ANYS: decoding : which line are you on?
ANYS: decoding : are you on a face or a scene?
ANYS: decoding : where are you in the map?
ANYS: decoding : which subgoal are you aiming for?

** TODO
DYCM:  start a dynamic causal modelling branch
PREC: update/fix DCM2NII and EXPAND functions
DATA: duration regressors
GLM:  improve scan_glm_setcontrasts
MVPA: set regressors from the scan3_mvpa.m file
MVPA: set runs properly
MVPA: create a mask automatically
MVPA: complete the scan3_mvpa_summarize.m file
MVPA: save results
MVPA: save-to-disk option (not to run out of RAM)
MVPA: when shifting regressors, it's taking a different name (so you don't use the shifted ones!)
MVPA: use d-prime to improve evaluation
MVPA: we're only using betas from the GLM

** LONG-TERM TODOs
PREC: re-run preprocessing without subsampling to improve mvpa.
MVPA: find a way to shut up the princeton-toolbox. and spm, ideally.
MVPA: write a fprintf line in the scan3_mvpa_*.m files
